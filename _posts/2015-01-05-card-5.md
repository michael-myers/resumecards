Some of my participation in open source:

* [Personal Blog about Security & Tech](https://michael-myers.github.io/blog)
* <a href="https://github.com/michael-myers/MacOS-WPA-PSK" target="_blank">MacOS-WPA-PSK</a>: a proof-of-concept script in Python showing that MacOS leaves the wifi network key unprotected in NVRAM (original research) (25+ stars)
* [ImportDeliciousToDiigo](https://github.com/michael-myers/ImportDeliciousToDiigo): a user account migration tool from Delicious to Diigo services, implemented as a standalone HTML5 file with embedded JavaScript.
