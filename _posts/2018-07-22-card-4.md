At [SPARTA](https://www.parsons.com/markets/Pages/Sparta.aspx) I provided low-level expertise in Windows malware and embedded software. For 5+ years I was lead developer and operational support for an offensive security project for a national security mission. I performed a mix of develoment, RE, and vuln. research.
